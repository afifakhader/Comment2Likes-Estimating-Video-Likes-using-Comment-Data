# Comment2Likes-Estimating-Video-Likes-using-Comment-Data
## Description

This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of likes a video will receive based on information extracted from its comments. By leveraging the valuable insights present in user comments, content creators, marketers, and platform administrators can gauge the potential popularity of their videos and optimize their content strategies accordingly.

## Approach

1. Data Cleansing: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to handle missing values, remove noise, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform descriptive and visual analyses to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the comment data and transform them into suitable numerical representations.
4. Model Development: Build a machine learning model to predict video likes based on the extracted features.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques.
